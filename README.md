# contractor
# The Contractor project is a very rudimentary example of a website built using the Pymongo database and Jinja 2 html templates. It's got full CRUD functionality in that the user can Add an item, View that item, Edit that item, and Delete that item.

#All tests work except edit_guitar. keep getting a 404 error no matter what i do.
